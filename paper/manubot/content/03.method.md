## Materials and methods {.page_break_before}

### Use cases in the life sciences
We evaluated FAIRness for four use-cases where researchers retrieve information from a repository or a database to answer their research question.
The first and the second use-cases are real research questions asked by researchers in our department, whereas the third and fourth use-cases are plausible research questions.
Use-case name used throughout the paper, research question, and repository or database investigated are:  

- Parkinsons_AE: What are the differentially expressed genes between normal subjects and subjects with Parkinson's diseases in the brain frontal lobe?
  To answer this question, the researcher looked for a dataset in ArrayExpress, a repository for microarray gene expression data based at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), United Kingdom [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkg091];
- NBIA_GEO: What is the function of mutation of WDR45 protein in the brain?
  In this case, the researcher looked for a dataset to analyze in Gene Expression Onmibus (GEO), a repository containing gene expression and other functional genomics data hosted at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), United States [@doi:10.1093/nar/30.1.207];
- TiO2_ENM: What are the concentrations of titanium dioxide that kill cells?
  The fictitious researcher looked for an answer in eNanoMapper, a database containing physical, chemical, and biological identity of nanomaterials [@doi:10.3762/bjnano.6.165];
- Caffeine_ChEBI: What are the biological roles of caffeine?
  In this case, the fictitious researcher looked data in ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest), a database containing chemical entities of biological interest hosted at EBI [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkm791].

### What is data and what is metadata?
The FAIR guidelines recursively use the terminology *data*, *metadata*, and  *(meta)data* <!-- (Table @tbl:maturity_indicators)-->.  
<!-- % , to allow certain degree of interpretation for the user [3] - [3]seminal or mons -->
For our computational implementation, we needed precise definitions of these terms.
Accordingly to the Merrian-Webster online dictionary, *data* are "information in digital form that can be transmitted or processed" [@url:https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data]
whereas *metadata* are "data that provides information about other data" [@url:https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metadata].
Following these definitions, we considered the answer to the research question as *data*, and  the extra information provided in the database about *data* as *metadata*.
In addition, we divided *metadata* (M) in subcategories according to the requirements of the FAIR guidelines (indicated with their enumeration):

- M(F2): Information that allows researchers to find the dataset s/he looks for. It coincides with the keywords used in the search;
- M(F3): Data identifier in the repository;  
- M(I3): Reference to other metadata;
- M(R1): Further information about data content, other than the search keywords;
- M(R1.1): Data license;
- M(R1.2): Data provenance: author name, publication title, and one author's email address
<!--	%See https://blog.datacite.org/exposing-doi-metadata-provenance/ with DOI https://doi.org/10.5438/wy92-xj57 -->

Metadata corresponding to guidelines F2 and R1 change with the research question, while the remaining metadata are independent from the research question.
We did not define M(1.3) as it requires community consensus.
In all cases, we assumed that *data* and *metadata* were hosted in the same repository.


### Calculating FAIR maturity indicators  
Because the guidelines stress on the importance of *data* and *metadata* being "machine-readable",
we collected information about datasets and repositories via application programming interface (API) wherever possible.  
For the first two use-cases, we asked the researchers to demonstrate how they performed the dataset retrieval using user interfaces in the browser, and we reproduced their search via API.
Similarly, for the two fictitious cases, we searched the answer to our question in databases and we reproduced the search via API.
To address all the metrics, we retrieved information from three different sources:   

- Database or repository:
  We queried the database or repository to get the dataset that answers the scientific question.
  Once found the dataset via API, we retrieved
  presence of keywords for M(F2) and
  presence of identifier for M(F3).
  In addition, we evaluated whether metadata are retrievable using a standard communication protocol for M(A1),
  the present of reference to other metadata for (I3),
  plurality of metadata (R1), and
  provenance (R1.2).  
- [re3data.org](www.re3data.org):
  We determined
  if the repository or database provides persistent identifier (F1 - manual?),
  presence and kind of license (R1.1)    
- [google.com](https://www.google.com):  To see if the
  dataset is indexed in searchable research (F4)  
- Email to repository curators: We asked for information that we could not retrieve via API or to confirm information we found in the online documentation, i.e.
  policy describing metadata accessibility when data are no longer available (A2), and
  structure of metadata representation (I1).

Finally, we did not calculate maturity indicators concerning use of FAIR vocabularies (I2), and meet domain-relevant community standards (R1.3).

To calculate the maturity indicators, we built on the already available implementations.
As a searchable resource (F4), we used [re3data.org](re3data.org), a registry containing metadata of more than 2000 data repositories from various disciplines.
[re3data.org](re3data.org) also provides information about licenses used if the repository provides unique and persistent identifiers (F1).

<!---
F1 from re3data. For now it is manual because it is the icon in the top-right - waiting for email to know if I can get it via api
-->
We assigned 1 when the principle was completely satisfied,  0 when it failed and 0.5 when we entered manual information.
We assigned decimal number for the principle F2, where we divided the number of found keywords in the metadata over the number or keywords used by the researcher.

<!--We represented the state of maturity indicators using balloon plots (Fig. @fig:outcome_comparison), where the area of each point corresponds to the level of maturity indicator.-->
