## Introduction {.page_break_before}


<!--DATA SHARING AND REUSE-->
Data sharing and data reuse are two complementary aspects of modern research activity.
Researchers share their data
for a sense of community,
to demonstrate integrity of acquired data, <!--integrity-->
and to enhance quality and reproducibility of research work [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0189288]. <!--and to benchmark findings and methodologies [cit].-->
In addition, data sharing is supported by
the emerging citation system for datasets,
scientific journals requirements,
and funding agencies that want to maximize their return on science investments [@doi:10.1038/d41586-019-01715-4], [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0018657].
At the same time, researchers are eager to reuse available data
to integrate information that answer interdisciplinary research questions
and to optimize use of fundings [@doi:10.1002/pra2.2018.14505501060].
*[The following part of this paragraph still requires some work]*
Although attitudes towards data sharing and reuse are increasingly favorable [12], data discovery and re-use remain difficult in practice [11].
Studies show that 40%  of  qualitative  data  sets  were  never downloaded, and about 25% of data is used just 1-10 times.
In addition, data availability decreases 17% per year [10] due to...
To happen, data sharing and reuse need appropriate data management, including  quality, standardization, ethics, and security [cit]. (infrastructure)
Data retrieval, the process of identifying and extracting data from a database using a query [@url:https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30140/data-retrieval], is one of the main challenges of data reuse.

In 2016, the FORCE 11 group proposed guidelines to increase data reuse in the life sciences.
These guidelines aimed to make data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, and were summarized in the acronym FAIR [@tag:tag_wilkinson_fair] (principles fully listed in Table <a href="#maturity_indicators">2</a>).
In a short time the FAIR guidelines have gained remarkable popularity, and  they are currently supported by funding agencies and political entities, such as the European Commission, the National Institutes of Health in the United States, and institutions in Africa and Australia [@doi:10.3233/ISU-170824].
In addition, academic and institutional initiatives were launched to promote and implement data FAIRness, such as [GOFAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/) and [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/).
Although largely adopted, the FAIR principles do not specify any technical requirement as they are deliberately intended as aspirational [@doi:10.3233/ISU-170824].
The lack of practical specifications generated a large spectrum of interpretations and concerns and raised the need to define measurements of data FAIRness.
Some of the authors of the seminal paper proposed a set of FAIR metrics [@tag:tag_wilkinson_metrics], subsequently reformulated as FAIR maturity indicators [@tag:tag_wilkinson_mi].
At the same time, they invited consortia and communities to suggest and create alternative evaluators.
The majority of the proposed tools are online questionnaires that researchers and repository curators can manually fill to assess the FAIRness of their data (Table <a href="#literature">1</a>).
However, the FAIR metrics guidelines stress on the importance of creating "objective, quantitative, machine-interpretable" evaluators [@tag:tag_wilkinson_metrics].
Following this criterion, two platforms have recently been developed to automatically compute FAIR maturity indicators: [FAIR Evaluation Services](https://fairsharing.github.io/FAIR-Evaluator-FrontEnd/#!/) and [FAIRshake](https://fairshake.cloud/).
The first platform offers evaluation of maturity indicators and compliance tests [@tag:tag_wilkinson_mi], whereas the second platform provides metrics, rubrics and assessments for registered digital resources [@doi:10.1101/657676].
Both platforms provide use-cases for FAIRness assessment, however they do not provide systematic analysis of evaluated datasets and repositories.
In the literature, two studies report evaluation of FAIRness for large datasets.
Dunning et al. [@tag:tag_dunning] used a qualitative approach to investigate 37 repositories and databases.
They assessed FAIRness using a traffic-light rating system that ranges from no to full compliance.
Weber et al. [@tag:tag_weber] implemented a computational workflow to analyze the retrieval of more than a million images from five repositories.
They proposed metrics specific for images, including time and place of acquisition to assess image provenance.
The first study provides valuable concrete guidelines to assess data FAIRness, whereas the second study constitutes a solid example of computational implementation.

*[The following paragraph still requires some work]* In this paper, we propose a computational approach to calculate FAIR maturity indicators in the life sciences.
We followed the recommendations provided by the Maturity Indicator Authoring Group [@tag:tag_wilkinson_mi] and we created a visualization tool to summarize and compare FAIR maturity indicators across various datasets and repositories.
We tested our approach on two real use cases of data retrieval to answer research questions in system biology.
We evaluated FAIRness for two repositories, i.e. ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus.  
Finally, we made our work open and reproducible by using the open language python in a Jupyter notebook/







<!--
Both data sharing and reuse require technical support to be in practice.
Researchers who want to share need public or institutional infrastructure where to store their data,
 as it has been shown that personal link broke. Shared data are commonly stored in private or public repositories.
Private repositories are not recommended as links to private repositories are often broken[7] and .
Public repositories are preferable as they provide unique data identifiers (DOI) that assure persistence of store data and provide valid support to researchers.

At the same time, researchers that want to reuse data must be able to find data.
-->
<!--
Data are the one of the basis of scientific investigations. Because of rapid technical advancement, researchers increasingly produce larger amounts of data at high speed.

It took 12 years to sequence the first human genome, while now scientists can sequence 200 human genome in one week due to the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) [@doi:10.1038/nature09796].
Similarly, ...
<!--(*double-check: this reference is from 2011, there might be more recent*).-->
<!--
This massive data production not only causes new technical challenges for data storage and management, but also is accompanied by a cultural change in the research community.
Traditionally, data usage follows a linear pattern: data are collected and analyzed, reported in publications, and stored in proprietary hardware [Griffit: @doi:10.12688/f1000research.12344.2],
and shared only with close collaborators [cit].
Nowadays, researchers are more and more willing to share their data and reuse data created in other laboratories.
In this work context, data management becomes fundamental.  Data need to be standardized, stored with safety and ethical care, high quality, and provide tools for citation.  
<!-- and to create knowledge [1] through hypothesis testing [9],  and they are the source of all deep learning and machine learning, in silico testing avoiding animal testing.-->
<!--%\shared data need to be open, properly documented and trustable, of high quality, with ethical approval, and a proper citation policy -->

Data sharing and data reuse are not trivial tasks.

One of the main point is that researchers need to be able to find the data that they need. Retrieving data is fundamental to reuse data. On of the guidelines we have is the FAIR metrics



Nice intro in Gregory:
Open research data are touted as having the potential to
transform science and fast-track the development of new knowledge (Gray, 2009).


Problems:
From Gary King \cite{King2007:

- URL are given, but they dont last for long.   
- Data created a few years ago

Data reuse is fundamental to researchers to maximize the amount of information that can be extracted from data while minimizing data creation costs.
In addition, data are important to

<!--%Databases are build with various architectures. Researchers usually access databases using the user interface. However, it is becoming more and more frequent to access databases with programmating access, which uses APIs. -->

<!--DATA SHARING AND REUSE IN OTHER DISCIPLINES-->

<!--Data sharing and reuse have been established common practices in some research fields for some years. See report + King

Sharing and reusing data requires infrastructure and guidelines.
Currently data are stored in databases with different architecture. This makes it hard for researchers to access the data in an organized and fruitful way.
Data sharing and reuse is not a novelty, as many disciplines (e.g. climatologists, ubatomic physics, see imming interview from page 25 but also others) have been doing it for a while.
FAIR principles explicit some of the data menagement principles used in communities that manage large amount of open data (e.g. Imming, page 14, page 19) + King
-->





<!---
Although in other disciplines data retrieval is well established, in the life sciences there is a lack of general guidelines.
Life sciences are very complex as they include various disciplines, such as toxicology, etc.



Although information retrieval (IR) has been extensively studied for over 60 years (Sanderson and Croft, 2012), data retrieval is a nascent field
The Open Archives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) [Lagoze et al. 2002] has been widely adopted as an approach to allow harvesting of metadata [Sompel].
In the life sciences (but not exclusively), the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) guidelines have gained remarkable popularity.

Critics about the practical implementation of the FAIR principle: Dunning (p.187)
The FAIR principles are one of the element for data management. focus on data harvest as they do not provide guidelines for other aspects of data management, such as openness, quality, standardization, ethics, and security [Mons].
The authors define these principles as aspirational [cit] and general so that they can be adaptable to specific requirements of different communities.

<!--harvestable in an interoperable manner (interoperability is about harvesting, not about data format, but about metadata formats)
Dunning: The FAIR guidelines are a fairly recent invention, published in 2014. Many of the data repositories have histories longer than that, and draw on discipline-based practices that have well established protocols for how data should be shared.s -->

<!--
History of FAIR:

-fairsharing.org website [Sansone2019]
-http://fairmetrics.org/: fair metrics working group. Metrics will be progressively implemented in the FAIRsharing registry [Sansone2019]

the ‘computability’ of standards is core to the development of FAIR metrics to measure the level of compliance of a given dataset against the relevant metadata [Sansone2019]

- vd. https://www.force11.org/datacitationprinciples

Three are the papers to reference for sure:    

- FAIR data
- FAIR metrics  
- nanopublications

Both machines and humans should be able to find the data

<!--FAIR METRICS - LITERATURE-->

<!--
Paragraph about Metrics
The main point here is about metrics.
For this reason there are attempts to measure the possiblity of reusing the data.
One way is to use linked data, and this is measured using the 5 star system and yummydata + King + Others tend to have already established internal and international guidelines (e.g. s)
The promoters of the FAIR principle have recently written a guideline for metrics. They are in this paper, a website and this github repository. They do not provide any concrete example on how to implement them. We tried to implement them in the context of nanomaterial. Safety of nanomaterials is of particular interest because they can be very dangerous. The European community strongly supports data integration to merge information, and the European community tells these people to apply the FAIR principle for their databases. Therefore we tested some databases to see if they are compliant to the FAIR metrics.
Bla bla on metrics with citation to their paper. Other works: Dunning et al analyzed 37 repositories (non solo repositories, but a bit of everything - see excel, CO-Frequencies and Proportions). Without explicitely mention the metrics (metrics paper out afterwards?), they tested the FAIR principle on repositories. We are going to do the same for nanosafety online databases
Current tools to assess FAIRness of data are developped by the European xxx () and by the NIH group (https://www.fairshake.cloud/), which allow
Tables


Definition - What does Database Repository mean?
A database repository is a logical, but also sometimes physical grouping of data from related but separate databases.

This is usually done when there is a 'higher purpose' for the data, but the data items needed to do this reside on different databases. In these cases a repository is necessary to bring together the discrete data items and operate on them as one.
-->


<!--OUR CONTRIBUTION-->


<!--
We analyze two data repositories (GE and Array Express) and two databases (ChEBI)
Array Express are repositories containing data in form of files that researchers download to compute their analysis and answer their questions.
eNanoMapper and ChEBI are repositories where data are not downloadable in the form of files and the extracted information are the data themselves.


where for database we

a database stores data. A repository is a special class of database which is designed to store meta-data, that is, data that describes other data.

Outline of the introduction:

- Importance of data-driven approaches in the life science  
- The number of produced data is increasing at extremely high rate  
- Differently from the past, researchers are more and more willing to share their data  
- At the same time, researchers are interested in reusing data  
- Data sharing and reuse are two sides of the same coin. It is important that researchers that share data provide sufficient information for data to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)  
- A few words about FAIR  
- There is need to quantify FAIRness: literature comparison about existing approaches  
- In this paper, we present one possible approach to calculate FAIR maturity indicators.
