## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Data reuse is crucial to enhance scientific progress and maximize return on science investments.
Given the incremented availability, manual and automatic retrieval of data for new research questions can be challenging.
Among the guidelines created to enhance data retrieval, the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles are increasingly adopted at an institutional and funding level.
Metrics to assess FAIRness of data repositories are under study and contributions are highly encouraged.
In this work, we propose four real use-cases of researchers retrieving data from four different repositories (eNanoMapper, ChEBI, Gene Expression Omnibus, and Array Express) to answer their research questions.
For each use case, we harvested data and metadata via application program interface (API) and we calculated FAIR metrics assigning “automatic pass” , “manual pass” and “ not passed” scores.
We found [...]. To conclude [...]
